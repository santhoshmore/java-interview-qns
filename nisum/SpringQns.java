	 ########### Difference b/w @Bean & @Resource
	 The main difference is that @Autowired wires per type and @Resource wires per bean name. 
	 @Autowired is a spring annotation whereas @Resource is specified by the JSR-250. So the latter is 
	 part of normal java where as @Autowired is only available by spring
