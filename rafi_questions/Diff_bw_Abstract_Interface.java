	 **** What is Interface ****
	 An interface is a reference type in Java. It is similar to class. It is a collection of abstract methods. A class implements an 
	 interface, thereby inheriting the abstract methods of the interface. Along with abstract methods, an interface may also contain 
	 constants, default methods, static methods, and nested types.
	 
	 **** Interface ****
	 1. If we don't know anything about implementation & just we have requirement specification we should for interface
	 2. every method present inside interface is always public & abstract whether we declared or not
	 3. we can't declare interface methods with the following modifiers, private, protected, static, final, synchronized.
	 4. Every variable present inside variable is "public static final" whether we are declaring or not.
	 5. we can't declare interface variables with the following modifiers private, protected, transient
	 6. For interface variables we have perform initialization at the time of declaration o.w we'll get compile time error
	 7. Inside interface we can't take constructor.
