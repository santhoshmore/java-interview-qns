	/*
	 A method without body (no implementation) is known as abstract method. A method must always be declared in an abstract class, or 
	 in other words you can say that if a class has an abstract method, it should be declared abstract as well
	 
Rules of Abstract Method
1. Abstract methods don’t have body, they just have method signature.
2. If a class has an abstract method it should be declared abstract, the vice versa is not true, which means an abstract class doesn’t 
   need to have an abstract method compulsory.
3. If a regular class extends an abstract class, then the class must have to implement all the abstract methods of abstract parent 
   class or it has to be declared abstract as well.	 
   
   *** Why abstract has constructor ?? ***
   # when any class extends an abstract class, the constructor of sub class will invoke the constructor of super class either
     implicitly or explicitly.
   # Abstract class constructor invoked when on instantiation of subclass, for this purpose Abstract class has constructor
