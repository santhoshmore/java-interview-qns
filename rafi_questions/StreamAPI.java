	/*
	 Introduced in Java 8, the Stream API is used to process collections of objects. A stream is a sequence of objects that supports 
	      various methods which can be pipelined to produce the desired result.
The features of Java stream are –

	# A stream is not a data structure instead it takes input from the Collections, Arrays or I/O channels.
    # Streams don’t change the original data structure, they only provide the result as per the pipelined methods.
    # Each intermediate operation is lazily executed and returns a stream as a result, hence various intermediate operations can be 
          pipelined. Terminal operations mark the end of the stream and return the result.
