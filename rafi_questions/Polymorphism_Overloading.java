	 The word polymorphism means having many forms. In simple words, we can define polymorphism as the ability of a message to be 
	 displayed in more than one form.

Real life example of polymorphism: A person at the same time can have different characteristic. Like a man at the same time is a father, 
a husband, an employee. So the same person posses different behaviour in different situations. This is called polymorphism.

Polymorphism is considered as one of the important features of Object Oriented Programming. Polymorphism allows us to perform 
a single action in different ways. In other words, polymorphism allows you to define one interface and have multiple implementations.
 The word “poly” means many and “morphs” means forms, So it means many forms.

In Java polymorphism is mainly divided into two types:

Compile time Polymorphism
Runtime Polymorphism

Method Overloading: When there are multiple functions with same name but different parameters then these functions are said to be
                    overloaded. Functions can be overloaded by change in number of arguments or/and change in type of arguments.
                    
Operator Overloading: Java also provide option to overload operators. For example, we can make the operator (‘+’) for string class to 
                      concatenate two strings. We know that this is the addition operator whose task is to add two operands. So a 
                      single operator ‘+’ when placed between integer operands, adds them and when placed between string operands, 
                      concatenates them.
In java, Only “+” operator can be overloaded:

To add integers
To concatenate strings
