	 # REST is an architectural style for developing applications that can be accessed over the network.
	 # Restful Web Services is a stateless client-server architecture where web services are resources and can be identified by their URIs.
	 # REST doesn’t specify any specific protocol to use, but in almost all cases it’s used over HTTP/HTTPS
	 # @Path: used to specify the relative path of class and methods. We can get the URI of a webservice by scanning the Path annotation value.
	 # @GET, @PUT, @POST, @DELETE and @HEAD: used to specify the HTTP request type for a method.
	 # @Produces, @Consumes: used to specify the request and response types.
	 # @PathParam: used to bind the method parameter to path value by parsing it.
