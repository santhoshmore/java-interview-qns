	 **** What is OOP's ****
	 Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form
	 of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often
	 modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated.
	 
	 OOP's concepts: 
	 1. Inheritance
	 2. Polymorphism 
	 3. Abstraction
	 4. Encapsulation
